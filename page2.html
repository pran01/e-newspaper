                WASHINGTON - The Supreme
                Court's conservative majority appeared
                skeptical Friday of the Biden administration's authority to impose a vaccine-or-testing requirement on
                the nation's large employers. The court also
                was hearing arguments on a separate
                vaccine mandate for most health care workers.
                The arguments in the two cases come
                at a time of spiking coronavirus cases
                because of the omicron variant, and the
                decision Friday by seven justices to
                wear masks for the firsttime while hearing arguments reflected the new phase
                of the pandemic.
                Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has
                had diabetes since childhood, didn't appear in the courtroom, choosing to remain in her office at the
                court and take
                part remotely. Two lawyers, representing Ohio and Louisiana, argued by telephone after recent positive
                COVID-19
                tests, state officials said.
                But the COVID-19 circumstances did
                not appear to outweigh the views of the
                courts six conservatives that the administration overstepped its authority
                in its vaccine-or-testing requirement
                for businesses with at least100 employees.
                "This is something the federal government has never done before," Chief
                Justice John Roberts said, casting doubt
                on the administration's argument that a
                half-century established law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, confers
                such broad authority.
                Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett probably
                hold the key to the outcome in both
                cases, as they have been more receptive
                to state-level vaccine requirements
                than the other three conservative justices. Barrett and Kavanaugh also had something to do with it.

                        With the rise in popularity of vaping
                        and CBD over the past few years, smoke
                        shops continue to open in Onslow
                        County, despite the already high number of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tobacco shops have always been
                        around in Onslow, especially with the
                        military presence, but as vaping and
                        CBD have grown in popularity over the
                        past several years, smoke shops continue to open in what could be considered an already
                        saturated
                        market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no longer a privilege license
                        requirement for tobacco shops, according to Jacksonville Planning and Permitting Director Ryan
                        King,
                        so there is no
                        record of the exact n umber ofshops currently in operation within Onslow
                        County.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the number of shops in the
                        county, some are tobacco vape, some
                        are strictly vape, and some sell CBD and
                        other items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the shops don't appear to
                        have any issues with business, despite
                        the competition,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Supply and demand," said Maxx Tobacco and Vapor store manager Nicole
                        Finn. "We sell what people buy every
                        day; cigarettes, cigars, lighters, disposable vapes, I mean, it's something thafs
                        always going to be sold."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finn said they haven't even been
                        open six months and their business
                        keeps getting busier and busier every
                        day, She thinks their location on Richlands Highway doesn't hurt.
                        However, DiamondTek Vapor manager Jen Stanton said she's over seeing
                        so many tobacco vape stores, and she
                        feels if a store sells tobacco products, it
                        shouldn't be allowed to sell vape
                        products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We have been one of the oldest
                        vape stores in this town next to Electra
                        Vapor and Vaporland," Stanton said.
                        "Our biggest thing is, as a true vapor
                        store, if you go into either this location
                        or our location off of Henderson, we
                        have no tobacco products. It is strictly
                        vape."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stanton believes most of the vape
                        and tobacco stores don't take the time
                        to help customers understand what
                        they're buying and how to safely use it.
                        She said their purpose at DiamondTek
                        has been to help people get off smoking cigarettes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tor all of the tobacco vape stores
                        that we see, thafs why we have so
                        many. They are not a true vape shop,"
                        Stanton said. "We're not trying to sell
                        you cigarettes, we're not trying to sell
                        you a quick convenience thing, and
                        that's where all these other places,
                        they've ended up being a convenience

                        Onslow County has received federal
                        assistance for its emergency needs
                        amid staff shortages and an increase
                        in calls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two fully-staffed FEMA Strike
                        Team ambulances from Texas have
                        been brought in for duty in Onslow, the
                        county s emergency services depart-
                        ment announced Thursday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Norman Bryson, director of Onslow
                        County Emergency Services, said CO-
                        VID-19 has contributed to the issue,
                        which he says isn't just a local prob-
                        lem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "There is a national shortage in
                        EMS staffing and personnel," Bryson
                        said, "With COVID going on, call vol-
                        umes are increasing."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Bryson, from 2019 to
                        2021, Onslow County EMS calls in-
                        creased by about 4,000 from roughly
                        20,000 in 2019 to more than 24,000 in
                        2021. The national shortage of EMS
                        staff, Bryson said, is alarming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "lt is starting to become more and
                        more concerning with the numbers
                        that we are seeing of people being out
                        and also people transitioning in the
                        workplace," Bryson said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The extra help was prompted from
                        the federal government level following
                        a state survey into the county's call
                        volume and staffing numbers, Bryson
                        said, who noted the assistance came at
                        no direct cost to the county, and other
                        areas of the state have also received
                        FEMA Strike Team ambulances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bryson said the ambulances will be
                        serving the county for at least two
                        weeks and his department is working
                        to remedy a lack of staffing, which he
                        said has been down around 15% from
                        normal levels.

                    <p>
                        The two teams on duty are from an
                        EMS system out of the Dallas area
                        called Medical Jets.
