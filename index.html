                WASHINGTON - The Supreme
                Court's conservative majority appeared
                skeptical Friday of the Biden administration's authority to impose a vaccine-or-testing requirement on
                the nation's large employers. The court also
                was hearing arguments on a separate
                vaccine mandate for most health care workers.
                The arguments in the two cases come
                at a time of spiking coronavirus cases
                because of the omicron variant, and the
                decision Friday by seven justices to
                wear masks for the firsttime while hearing arguments reflected the new phase
                of the pandemic.
                Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has
                had diabetes since childhood, didn't appear in the courtroom, choosing to remain in her office at the
                court and take
                part remotely. Two lawyers, representing Ohio and Louisiana, argued by telephone after recent positive
                COVID-19
                tests, state officials said.
                But the COVID-19 circumstances did
                not appear to outweigh the views of the
                courts six conservatives that the administration overstepped its authority
                in its vaccine-or-testing requirement
                for businesses with at least100 employees.
                "This is something the federal government has never done before," Chief
                Justice John Roberts said, casting doubt
                on the administration's argument that a
                half-century established law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, confers
                such broad authority.
                Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett probably
                hold the key to the outcome in both
                cases, as they have been more receptive
                to state-level vaccine requirements
                than the other three conservative justices. Barrett and Kavanaugh also had something to do with it.
